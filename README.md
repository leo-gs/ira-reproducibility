## nodetable.csv
Each node represents a Twitter account (22,020 observations x 7 variables)
- Id: the hashed user id (maps to the `Source` and `Target` columns in the edgetable)
- AccountCreationDatetime: the creation date and time creation of the Twitter account
- InfoMapTopLevelCluster: the top-level cluster generated by running the InfoMap algorithm on the retweet graph; our analysis was focused on the 29 IRA accounts in the two main clusters (1 and 2), although there is 1 additional IRA account in cluster #188
- RetweetParentCount: the number of times the account was retweeted by an account in the graph (within the context of the *LM tweet dataset described in our paper)
- RetweetChildCount: the number of times the account retweeted an account in the graph (within the context of the *LM tweet dataset described in our paper)
- Label: the Twitter handle of the account (only shown for the 30 known IRA accounts)
- IsIraAccount: a binary value indicating whether the account was on the list of known IRA accounts (1 = yes, 0 = no)

## edgetable.csv
Each edge represents a retweet between two accounts/nodes (58,698 observations x 4 variables)
- Source: the hashed user id of the source/parent account of the retweet (i.e. the account that authored the original tweet); this maps to the `Id` column in the nodetable
- Target: the hashed user id of the target/child account of the retweet (i.e. the account that authored the retweet); this maps to the `Id` column in the nodetable
- TweetID: the tweet ID of the retweet (obtained from Twitter)
- TweetDatetime: the date and time of the retweet
