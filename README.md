\cb3 - Id: the hashed user id (maps to the `Source` and `Target` columns in the edgetable)\cb1 \
\cb3 - AccountCreationDatetime: the creation date and time creation of the Twitter account\cb1 \
\cb3 - InfoMapTopLevelCluster: the top-level cluster generated by running the InfoMap algorithm on the retweet graph; our analysis was focused on the 29 IRA accounts in the two main clusters (1 and 2), although there is 1 additional IRA account in cluster #188\cb1 \
\cb3 - RetweetParentCount: the number of times the account was retweeted by an account in the graph (within the context of the *LM tweet dataset described in our paper)\cb1 \
\cb3 - RetweetChildCount: the number of times the account retweeted an account in the graph (within the context of the *LM tweet dataset described in our paper)\cb1 \
\cb3 - Label: the Twitter handle of the account (only shown for the 30 known IRA accounts)\cb1 \
\cb3 - IsIraAccount: a binary value indicating whether the account was on the list of known IRA accounts (1 = yes, 0 = no)\cb1 \
